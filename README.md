# Handling Null Values in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript: how to gracefully handle unexpected null values passed as function arguments. The `foo` function showcases a simple yet effective way to prevent errors and ensure the program behaves predictably.  The solution provides clear explanation and demonstrates that null handling is very crucial for robust code. 

## Problem

When a function receives null values for arguments it expects to be numbers, it may throw errors or produce incorrect results. This is especially true in situations where external data is involved.

## Solution

Explicitly checking for null values and implementing appropriate error handling, such as returning a default value like 0, ensures the function operates safely without unexpected crashes.
